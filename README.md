To get this app up and running, fork and clone the repository.

To set up the Rails server:

$ bundle install
$ rake db:create

Since it runs on Postgres, you'll need to open a Postgres server to run locally.  

To set up the React client side:

$ cd client npm install
$ cd ..

Now the application should be ready to launch!

$ rake start
